# MBot-LED-Settings-App
This app was made with kivy and @xecos library for contrlling the mbot with python

There are 3 textinputs for the red , green and blue. 2 labels that are literally useless you can change them and 1 button to update everything.
When your un this you can only use it once idk why.

If you are going to use this code sure you can but you won't be able to use the application more than once becuase kivy will crash the window
